# Reflections on the toycity-part3 -project #

1.How long did you spend working on this project?

	I spent couple of nights working, maybe 3-4h

2.What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

	At all getting the project to work and also the extra features

3.What two additional features did you build? Why?

	I added the ability to show the whole customer list and
	a way to show time of purchases. I believe these could be 
	usefull functions in retail.

4.Where do you still have room to grow?

	Yes, I find it extremely hard to start these projects unless there is 
	enough help to get started. All in all, I need a lot more practise
	in Ruby. And coding in general.
